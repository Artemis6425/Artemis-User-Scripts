# Artemis-User-Scripts
Various user scrips I've modified to work the way I want to, or created from scratch.

Credit will be given to where I get them, and I will also list what changes I made.

If you have any updates, please let me know! My discord is `Artemis6425`

These scripts require the usage of [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), or some other userscript extension.

### Description
Allows the user to have a list of streams to remove from category directories

The included array of streams to remove are 24/7 streams, primarily in the Super Mario 64 directory.
